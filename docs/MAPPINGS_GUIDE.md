# How to Add Your Language – No Coding Skills Needed!

You only need to know your mother tongue.

### Step 1: Choose your file
Go to `src/mappings/` and open:
- `yoruba.js` → if you speak Yorùbá
- `igbo.js` → if you speak Igbo
- `pidgin.js` → if you speak Pidgin

### Step 2: Add one line (example)
```js
"fiHàn": "console.log",     // Yorùbá: show on screen
"jẹ́": "let",               // Yorùbá: be / let
"ìfihan": "alert",          // Yorùbá: display message

Step 3: Test it!
Open playground → type your new word → it works instantly!
Every word you add helps 10,000+ children code in their own language.
You are building the future of African tech — one word at a time.
