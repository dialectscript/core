# 06 How to Type ọ, ṣ, ị, ụ on Any Phone (10 seconds)

Android:
Settings → System → Languages & input → GBoard → Languages → Add Yorùbá / Igbo → done!

iPhone:
Settings → General → Keyboard → Keyboards → Add New Keyboard → Yoruba or Igbo

No tone marks needed — Dialect Script accepts:
ọ == o    ṣ == s    ị == i    ụ == u

Kid can type “oburuna” and it still works perfectly.
